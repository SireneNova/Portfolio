Postings are the result of projects or homework assignments that required independent creation of code, however simple. This differs from my Coursework repository, which contains work created by following steps. Some highlights are listed below.

## Python
* Built a dynamic [graphical sale viewer](https://github.com/rebeccapizano/Portfolio/tree/master/Python/Version27/SaleViewer) that imports data from a csv.
* Built a [gui that moves files](https://github.com/SireneNova/Portfolio/tree/master/Python/Version34/FileTransferProgram) between select folders if they have been changed within 24 hours.

## JavaScript
* Built an [expense tracker web app](https://github.com/rebeccapizano/Portfolio/tree/master/JavaScript/ExpenseWebApp) with a report page, Node/Express server, NeDB database, and Vue elements.
* Built a [news page](https://github.com/rebeccapizano/Portfolio/tree/master/JavaScript/MenuExercise) with Lightbox pictures, Bootstrap elements, and dynamic JavaScript and CSS menus.

## SQL
* Built a [library database](https://github.com/rebeccapizano/Portfolio/tree/master/Database-SQL) with queries that organize the information for different purposes.

## HTML & CSS

## C#
* Built a series of [apps](https://github.com/rebeccapizano/Portfolio/tree/master/CSharp/ConsoleApps) that demonstrated the basic use of different objects and features in C#.
