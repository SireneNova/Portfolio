### Portfolio of original work
---
Postings are mostly the result of drills and assignments in The Tech Academy that required independent creation of code, however simple. This differs from my Coursework repository, which contains work created by following steps. Some highlights are listed below.

###Python
* Built a dynamic [graphical sale viewer] that imports data from a csv.
* Built a [gui that moves files] between select folders if they have been changed within 24 hours.
