####Objective
Create a login page using HTML5 and CSS3.

####Steps Taken
* Made a login page in basic HTML, loginstyled.html.
* Included buttons, checkboxes, and links.
* Made a separate CSS file to provide the styling, loginstyle.css.
* Included wing images and soft gradients for a heavenly 3-D look.

####Results
Through the design process, I learned:
* How to float elements outside of margins and many other position tricks. 
* How to apply various gradients.
* How to import custom font styles.
* How to create different effects upon hovering and selecting.
* That color codes have to have a # sign to work unless they are words.
* That some browsers have individual CSS capabilities. I tried to make it as broadly compatible as possible.

I was impressed that this markup language combo allowed me to achieve pretty much every effect I imagined.
