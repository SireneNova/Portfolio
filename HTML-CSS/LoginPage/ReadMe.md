A login page to heaven made with HTML5 and CSS3. These files are also contained in the zipped folder.

Through the design process, I learned:
* How to float elements outside of margins and many other position tricks. 
* How to apply various gradients.
* How to import custom font styles.
* How to create different effects upon hovering and selecting.
* That color codes have to have a # sign to work unless they are words.
* That some browsers have individual CSS capabilities. I tried to make it as broadly compatible as possible.

Many effects I desired took patience to figure out, but pretty much every one possible to achieve. I was really impressed with the capabilities of this markup language combo.
