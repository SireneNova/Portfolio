An exercise in making menus and using JavaScript on a fictitious news page. 
The static HTML and CSS was made following a tutorial by the Little Web Hut. 
I added the JS dropdown, CSS dropdown, and Lightbox images.
The news.js file is the same as the one in the compressed folder, which contains all files to view the page.
