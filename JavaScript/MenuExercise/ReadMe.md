###News Page Styling with JavaScript and CSS Tools
___
####Objective
* Using JavaScript, on a news page created previously, add a menu of 3-4 items that extends downward when rolled over with a mouse.
* Learn Lighbox and use it to add images to the page.
* Learn Bootstrap and use it to enhance the page.

####Steps Taken
* Previously made the original static HTML and CSS following a tutorial on LittleWebHut.com at this [link]. An image of this page is included as "before.png" in the beforeAfterPics folder.
* My coding additions for this project are contained in first.html, style.css, and news.js.
* Made "JS Menu" using mouseenter and mouseleave functions in news.js.
* Added a "CSS Menu" for comparison using the CSS hover attribute.
* Downloaded Lightbox2 from the creator's [website], and followed the getting started to add images (in AllFiles).
* Downloaded and studied Bootstrap from getbootstrap.com.
* Added "Bootstrap Menu" using the Dropdown feature of Bootstrap, which applies CSS and JS.
* Added hover text over "Be a News Reporter" using the Tooltip feature of Bootstrap, which applies CSS and JS.
* Manually applied Bootstrap CSS text centering. Bootstrap CSS automatically restyled the body text.
* Applied additional CSS font styling over Bootstrap.

####Results
All items I added worked. Through this project I learned:
* How Bootstrap and Lightbox work, and how to use them.
* How to create menu dropdowns using 3 different methods.
* How to override styling. The order of referencing external sheets matters.
* That there are different ways to perform the same function.
  * In news.js I commented an alternative way to call the dropdown in bootstrap.

AllFiles.zip is a compressed folder containing all files to view the page. In addition to all files listed above, it contains files to view the Lightbox images.

The [beforeAfterPics] folder contains images of the page before and after my changes.
