## Horror Game Project
The Tech Academy gives students a final team project to work on called a Live Project. In it, students contribute towards a software product for a real client while practicing Scrum methodologies. My experience joining an ongoing project is described below.
___
### Objective

1. Contribute toward a JavaScript-based story-driven horror game in a 2-week sprint.
2. Complete and attend daily standups, planning meetings, sprint reviews, and storytimes.

### Steps Taken

1. Familiarized myself with what had already been produced. To improve my understanding, I asked questions and reviewed learning resources in JavaScript and Bootstrap.
2. Was given a suggested task to repeat a set of code that would ensure a time delay would be maintained when the page was refreshed.
3. Discovered a side effect of the code in step 2 and told my team about it.
4. Found other problems in the script related to the time delay. Story text was positioned in interfering locations, so I moved it.
5. Made a function that automatically calculated time delay. (The value for time delay had been manually counted for each step of the story before.)
6. Completed the teamwork and attendance requirements. Gave consistent updates on my progress via email and the meetings. 

### Results

* My fixes for the problems in step 4 worked.
* My team is now aware of the problem in step 3.
* My function for calculating time delay worked. I could not, however, get the script to automatically use the value calculated.
* Exceeded my project manager's expectations with what I accomplished. 
* The new problems I identified will give future students joining the project something to work on.
