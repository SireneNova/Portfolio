## Expense Tracker - Single Page App

I undertook this project during my job search to test and expand on my JavaScript and web design skills. 
I learned and applied at least 4 new technologies in completing it. 
It works in Chrome.
The projectFiles compressed folder contains the entire applicaton. The file structure is also laid out above. 
___

### Objective
* Create a single page app that tracks expenses, including date, description, and amount.
* Include a form to enter a new expense and view a table of old expenses.
* Include a text search to filter expenses by description.
* Use Vue JS front end library.
* Use Node JS with Express to create a restful api.
* Use nedb to create a database.
* Add a report page that shows total expenses per week per year.  
* Make it clean and responsive for use on mobile devices.

### Steps Taken
1. Skimmed a Lynda tutorial on Node JS. Identified a section on Express and building web servers, and focused on that. 
2. Reviewed online resources on NeDB, Vue, and JSON.
3. Built a web server with Node and Express. Connected routes to an NeDB database.
4. Created client-side web pages and script with user input and dynamic tables. Used Vue to control some titles.
5. The main input page contains table filters.
6. The report page contains object filters and calculations dealing with JSON.

### Results
1. The web page works in Chrome, but not Firefox, due to a difference in the way the browsers deal with date formatting. It is designed to work on mobile-sized browsers as well. 
2. I learned how to use Node, create restful apis, use NeDB, use Vue, and deal with JSON objects, all of which was completely new. 
3. I also strengthened my skills with JQuery.
