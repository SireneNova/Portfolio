# This is a very visual problem. Count the number of pairs of intersecting discs. A disc is represented in an array A with it's center at i of each item A[i] in the array, where A[i] equals the radius. 
# It is easy to miss in the problem statement, but the intersection of a disk is when the areas of the discs intersect and not just the borders. 
# This was a point of misunderstanding at first.
# This is in the sorting section. It has been hard to see what kind of sorting would make this faster.
# The function should return âˆ’1 if the number of intersecting pairs exceeds 10,000,000.

# Here is a correct solution that scores 62% due to performance. The performance is O(N^2) but is improved 12% over an earlier version.
# This solution is quite complicated. 
# It creates disc objects out of the array, sorts them by top range, compares the overlap using a variable, and, if it needs to, compares using a dictionary.
# I usually avoid using Python for objects because it is awkward. There is more information entered into the discs than is needed, but I may experiment more with it.
