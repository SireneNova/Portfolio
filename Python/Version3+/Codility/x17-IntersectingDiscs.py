# This is a very visual problem. Count the number of pairs of intersecting discs. A disc is represented in an array A with it's center at i of each item A[i] in the array, where A[i] equals the radius. 
# It is easy to miss in the problem statement, but the intersection of a disk is when the areas of the discs intersect and not just the borders. 
# This was a point of misunderstanding at first.
# This is in the sorting section. It has been hard to see what kind of sorting would make this faster.
# The function should return âˆ’1 if the number of intersecting pairs exceeds 10,000,000.

# Here is a correct solution that scores 68% due to performance. The performance is O(N^2) but is improved 18% over the first version.
# This solution creates disc objects out of the array to keep track of their top and bottom, and then sorts them by bottom. 
# It then iterates through the discs while keeping track of the tops as it goes and sorts this list of tops.
# It compares the bottom of each disc to the list of tops. 
# If the bottom of the disc is less than the minimum top, it that means it intersects with all discs below it, and the count can be increased by the position of the disc.
# If not, the count can be set to the disc position minus the number of previous tops that are less than the disc bottom.
# I usually avoid using Python for objects because it is awkward. There is more information entered into the discs than is needed, but I may experiment more with it.
