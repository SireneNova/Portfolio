# DataQuest
5-7-2021

DataQuest is an online learning platform for data science. At the end of each section, there is a guided portfolio project that students complete in the form of a Jupyter notebook or Markdown file. A Jupyter notebook may contain a mixture of markdown and code. Mine are included in this folder. I explain each project's goals and analyses in the markdown throughout the files.

Originally added as a Jupyter notebook 5-7-2021. Switched to a markdown file on 4-4-2022 later due to the space Jupyter notebooks take up, which skews my coding profile.
