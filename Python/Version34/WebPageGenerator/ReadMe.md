# Web Page, GUI, and Database

___
## Objective
* Create a program that generates a basic webpage with text.
* Create an interface that allows the user to customize what is written on the page.
* Create a backend database that saves previous entries into a selection list from which page text can be chosen.

## Steps Taken
* Wrote a python file that opens a basic web page (P70Drill-webPage).
* Used tkinter to create a GUI that allowed the user to enter text for the web page (P72Drill-webPageGUI).
* Used sqlite3 to create the backend database (P73Drill-webPageGUIdb).

## Results
Successfully used different tools to make a python application that combines a graphical interface and database to generate text on web pages and save entries. Got more experience with Sqlite3 and Tkinter. The text dialog box could be made wider as an improvement.
