# Spring Game

___
## Objective
Create a console game using Python 3.4 and conditional loops.

## Steps Taken
* Decided on a Spring holiday theme since it happened to be March.
* Combined while loops, conditionals, and input functions to write a story game in which the user is asked riddles by a leprachaun and gains points in the form of easter eggs and other surprises.
* Used internet sources such as whoohoo humorous irish dialect translator and pages of easter riddles to create content. Made some of my own riddles.

## Results
* Got experience nesting conditionals, input and output, other code, and creative writing in while loops to create a game.
* Became more familiar with string functions such as concatenation, the use of backslashes, and changing case.
