## Range Drill

___
### Objective
Display ranges in Python as requested in an assignment.

### Steps Taken
* The questions are commented throughout the file. They ask to display specific ranges. The code that achieves it follows each.

### Results
* What can be confusing at first about forward-stepping ranges is that the endpoint is always counted from a start of 0, so the range ends at a number behind the specified endpoint. 
* Similar logic applies to backward-stepping ranges, only counting down. This can also be confusing. The starting point is displayed as specified, and the range ends at a number larger than the specified endpoint.
