# Graphical User Interface Window

___
## Objective
Create a graphical user interface with wxPython.

## Steps Taken
* Made a GUI with a menu bar, submenus, a panel, toolbar, textbox, and buttons with and without goofy images. 
* I applied what I learned from a YouTube tutorial series by Sentdex: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDc4SQhfpm6XHO0l-1Ybtur2 

## Results
* I can now make a user interface window with Python similar to a window you would find in an application such as MS Word.
