# Sale Viewer
---
The final practical exercise in a Python course was to create a program of your own design. I chose to create a dynamic sale viewer, inspired by a shop owner who had wanted to view her sales per store side-by-side when her software didn't allow her to.

## Objective
Create a program with options to view sale data graphically as
* a multi-bar chart of sales per month per store
* a multi-bar chart of profit per month per store

## Steps Taken
1. Created a flowchart and had it approved by an instructor
2. Created a csv file of dummy sales data (stores, products, sales, expense, price, profit)
3. Created a Python program in Visual Studio that had options to 
    * import the csv data with SQLite
    * view the data as a multi-bar chart with matplotlib as:
        * sales per month per store
        * profit per month per store
    * continue or exit the program after each operation

## Results
It worked. I refreshed my memory on how to import csv files to SQLite, use SQL commands, and organize the code to get it to run as a program. I learned new ways of manipulating and converting strings, lists, and tuples. I also learned how to create bar charts with matplotlib. I spent much time researching how to get the legend to where I wanted it. It cuts off by default if moved outside the plot. I am now more comfortable using Python and the useful modules sqlite3, numpy, matplotlib, and csv.
