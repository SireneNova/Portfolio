# Lynda Delegates, Events, Lambdas Online Course Challenge Responses

___
## Objective
Write programs in response to challenge questions at the end of lessons in the Lyda Course "Delegates, Events, and Lambdas". It consists of 3 lessons, Delegates, Events, and Lambdas, respectively, with a challenge question at the end of it.
Each file in this folder responds to a separate question:
### Events
allow user to enter positive and negative amounts
track that amount in piggy bank
display the new amount after each entry
when the amount reaches or exceeds 500, display a message like "you've reached your goal"
### Lambdas
Rewrite Events challenge  piggy bank with lambdas

## Steps Taken
Watched the lessons in the Lynda course. Attempted the Delegates response and left it in the Coursework section since I needed more guidance to complete it. 
Wrote working programs for the Events and Lambdas.
### Events
Wrote separate functions that wrote the piggy bank amount to the console after each entry and incremented the entry. Divided them into separate classes.

### Lambdas
Re-wrote the previous code, subscribing the functions with lambdas.

## Results
The code worked both ways. Learned that dividing functionality into units such as classes looks pretty clean. Using lambdas significantly shortened the length of code.
