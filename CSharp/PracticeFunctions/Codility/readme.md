LongestBinaryGap is a response to a training exercise in codility to find the longest binary gap in a given number when the number is converted to binary. The function takes an integer input, converts it to a binary string, and finds the longest sequence of zeros that are surrounded by 1 on the front and back end of the sequence.
For example: 10000100101 has a longest binary gap of 4.
