Person.cs is an exercise in creating a simple class with certain properties and functions specified in the problem statement. It was my goal to make it clean, using traditional getters and setters. I chose for the getters and setters to be protected because it seemed they would not need to be externally called. A person can be instantiated with an age and functions of the class can be called that increment age and report if the person is "old" or not. The ages at which to decide what is "old" were given as part of the problem statement.
