Socks is a function that finds the number of pairs of socks in an array of ints, with each distinct int representing a color of sock. There are other ways to do this, but I chose dictionaries to practice usimg them in c#, and because it made sense to me. I realized it is much more efficient to deal with dictionaries in Python.
