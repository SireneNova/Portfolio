## Demo Series Drill
___
### Objective

Create classes and methods that demonstrate:

1. The difference between overloading methods and overriding methods, showing each in operation
2. Creation of a derived class
3. Each of these access modifiers: public, protected, internal, private, protected internal
4. Creation of a sealed class
5. Use of an interface
6. Use of a try/catch/finally block
7. Handling an exception by writing the important data from the exception to a log file on the local machine
8. Value types vs. reference types
9. Use of the keyword ‘this’
10. Serialization of an object - in this case, a BLOB (Binary Large Object’). The object should be streamed to a text file. 
Show also the retrieval of the object from that file and conversion back to its original form. (deserializing)
11. Differences between an abstract class and an interface, in terms of creation and use of each
12. Creation and use of a delegate
13. Creation and use of a multicast delegate
14. Creation of a struct
15. Creation and use of nullable types
16. Creation and use of an Enumerable

### Steps Taken
* A program was made for each demonstration requested.
* Sources of aid are listed at the end of the files. 
* See my coursework repository for example 10 of [serialization and deserialization], made following a tutorial.
[serialization and deserialization]: https://github.com/SireneNova/Coursework/tree/master/CSharp/SerializationDeserialization

### Result
* Each program works and is listed as the name of the example.
