## Fantasy Library Database
___
LibraryDrill.sql is an exercise in creating and modifying databases in SQL Server. It fulfills a course assignment.

### Objective
* Create a database schema for a library management system following a given outline of table and column names.
  * Example: Make table BOOK with columns BookID, Title, PublisherName.
* Make SQL script to populate the tables with dummy data, while ensuring given conditions are true.
  * Example condition: There must be a book called "The Lost Tribe".
* Create SQL queries to answer given questions.
  * Example question: For each book that is loaned from the "Sharpstown" branch and whose DueDate is today, retrieve the book title, the borrower's name, and the borrower's address.

### Steps Taken
* Populated the tables with names, addresses, and phone numbers of fictional characters and places in pop culture as well as some I invented.
* Designed queries to access and organize the information as requested by the assignment questions.
* The assignment questions are commented before each set of code steps that answered them.

### Results
* This allowed me to internalize the SQL I had learned, including the use of joins, procedures, creating, selecting, and "go". 
* Had fun in the process.
